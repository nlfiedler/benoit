  <h1>Benoit README</h1>

  <h2>What Is It?</h2>

  <p>Benoit is a Java application that renders the Mandelbrot Set to
  the screen. It has the capability to use arbitrary precision in its
  numeric calculations.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Running Benoit</h2>

  <p>To run Benoit from the jar file, invoke the <code>java</code>
  command like so: <kbd>java -jar benoit.jar</kbd></p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Features</h2>

  <h3>History</h3>

  <p>Benoit supports a history of visited regions of the set. That is,
  as you visit regions of the set, the boundaries are saved in the
  order they were viewed. You can visit old regions using the left
  arrow button in the toolbar. To see the more recent regions, use the
  right arrow button.</p>

  <h3>Image Caching</h3>

  <p>Benoit attempts to cache the rendered images in a memory sensitive
  manner. That is, if there is sufficient free memory, the images will
  be cached indefinitely. Under low-memory conditions, some or all of
  the cached images may be freed. Thus revisiting past regions of the
  set (using the Back button), may result in the image being rendered
  again, while other times it may appear immediately.</p>

  <h3>Precision</h3>

  <p>Benoit allows performing the calculations using arbitrary numeric
  precision. It supports both double and BigDecimal precision. By
  default it uses doubles, which are less precise but very fast. The
  BigDecimal type is an object that represents a real number without
  any loss of precision. The default scale of the BigDecimal is 30
  digits. If you want more digits, you must use the &quot;Set
  Scale&quot; menu item in the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</p>

  <p>You will notice that BigDecimals are incredibly slow compared to
  doubles. For this reason, the rendering algorithm is significantly
  different than the one used when the calculations are performed with
  doubles. This is to allow a rough representation of the region to
  appear initially, which is continually refined in subsequent
  passes.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Building Benoit</h2>

  <p>To compile the program from source code, you will need the Benoit
  source package and <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>.
  With Ant installed and the Benoit source extracted to the current
  directory, type the following to compile the source code:</p>
  <pre>
ant compile
</pre>

  <p>Then use <kbd>ant go</kbd> to run the compiled program.</p>
