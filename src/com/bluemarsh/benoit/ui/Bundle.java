 * contains the resources defined in the Bundle.properties file within
 * this package. Only the classes in this package will use this particular
 * class. Identical Bundle classes will exist in all of the packages in
 * which resources are needed.
 * Granted, this implies that the class is reproduced verbatim from
 * one package to the next, but it is very fast and efficient.
