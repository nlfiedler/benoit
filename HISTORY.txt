2.2
- Fixed bug 776: percent complete for big decimal renderer would roll
  from zero to 20 fives times, once for each step of the refinement.
- Centered the main window by default, sizing to fit the screen if it
  is too small for the default window size.

2.1 - July 2, 2002
- Back and forward buttons are enabled and disabled appropriately.
- Window is now resizable and image is shown in a scroll pane.
- Added ability to open more than one window at a time.
- Fixed yet another mistake in which doubles were used instead of
  BigDecimal. Now big-decimal computation is extremely slow.
- The BigDecimal renderer uses successive-refinement to display
  region, rather than the recursive rectangles algorithm.
- Added a few more interesting presets.

2.0 - June 26, 2002
- Actually uses a good design this time around.
- Uses a decent color scheme for the first time.
- Corrected a problem in which the parameters were always doubles,
  despite what may have been selected in the menu. Now we find out
  that rendering with BigDecimals is extremely slow.
- Now just supports doubles and BigDecimal with arbitrary scale.
- Eliminated the multiple window interface in favor of just the
  main window.
- Defaults to larger 640x492 image resolution. Window is not resizable.
- Now uses a region history, like a browser history, with limited
  image caching.
- Contains presets to view interesting parts of the set.

1.1 - March 13, 1999
- Applied the GNU General Public License to Benoit.

1.0 - September 23, 1998
- First numbered release.
